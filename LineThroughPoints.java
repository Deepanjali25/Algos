/* You're given an array of points plotted on a 2D graph (the xy-plane). Write a function that returns the maximum
number of points that a single line (or potentially multiple lines) on the graph passes through. The input array
will contain points represented by an array of two integers [x, y] . The input array will never contain
duplicate points and will always contain at least one point.
Sample Input:
points = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [0, 4], [-2, 6], [4, 0], [2, 1],]
Sample Output: 4 // A line passes through points: [-2, -6], [0, 4], [2, 2], [4, 0].
Hint1 The brute-force approach to solve this problem is to consider every single pair of points and to form a line
using them. Then, for each line, you determine how many points lie on that line by using the equation of the line
you formed and checking if each pointâ€™s coordinates solve the equation. This solution runs in O(n^3) time; can you
come up with a better approach?
Hint2 What does it mean if two lines have the same slope and share a point?
Hint3 If two lines have the same slope and share a point, they're the same line. Try using a hash table to store the
slopes of lines that pass through certain points. How does this help you write an algorithm that runs in 0(n^2) time?
Hint4 Loop through every single pair of points, picking a p2 for every p1 in order to form a line. For every pair
(p1, p2) ,store the slope of the formed line in a hash table, and map it to the number of points on that line. If
you ever find two identical slopes for lines that both use the same point p1 , you can consider these lines to be
one and the same, meaning that points p1, p2a, and p2b are all on the same line; in those cases, update the
number of points on the slope (the line) in the hash table accordingly. You'll need to reset the hash table at each
change of p1.
