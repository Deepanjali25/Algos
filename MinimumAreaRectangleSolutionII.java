/* You're given an array of points plotted on a 2D graph (the xy-plane). Write a function that returns the minimum
area of any rectangle that can be formed using any 4 of these points such that the rectangleâ€™s sides are parallel
to the x and y axes (i.e., only rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides should be considered--no rectangles
with diagonal sides). If no rectangle can be formed, your function should return 0. The input array will contain
points represented by arrays of two integers [x, y] . The input array will never contain duplicate points.
Sample Input:
points =[[1, 5], [5, 1], [4, 2], [2, 4], [2, 2], [1, 2], [4, 5], [2, 5], [-1, -2], ]
Sample Output:
3
// The rectangle with corners [1, 5], [2, 5], [1, 2], and [2, 2] has the minimum area: 3.
Hint1 The brute-force approach to this problem is to simply generate all possible combinations of 4 points and to
see if they form a rectangle. You can calculate the area of all of these rectangles and then return the minimum
area that you find. Is there a better approach than this?
Hint2 A more optimal approach is to find vertical or horizontal edges that are parallel to the y or x axes,
respectively. If you find two parallel edges (two vertical edges, for example) that share a vertical or horizontal
coordinate (y values in the case of vertical edges), then those edges form a rectangle.
Hint3 Another approach is to pick any two points that don't have the same x or y values (i.e.,
points that could be at opposite ends of a rectangle diagonal) and to see if you can create
a rectangle with them and two other points. Given two points where p1 = (x1, y1)
and p2 = (x2, y2) ,if points p3 = (x1, y2) and p4 = (x2, y1) exist, then
these 4 points form a rectangle.
